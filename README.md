# Network Intrusion Dashboard in Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing network intrusions using the [Kaggle Network Intrusion Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection).

## Overview
This dashboard visualizes intrusion rates by protocol (e.g., TCP at ~80% anomaly) and flag (e.g., SH at 100%), with interactive slicers for `protocol_type`, `flag`, and `service`, key metrics like `Sum of Hot Flags` (4989) with tooltips, and a clean, user-friendly design. It helps identify potential security threats by highlighting high-risk patterns in network traffic.

## Features
- Visualizations: Intrusion rate by class, protocol, and flag.
- Interactive slicers for filtering by `protocol_type`, `flag`, and `service`.
- Key metrics with tooltips for context (e.g., "Hot Flags indicate attempts to access sensitive files").
- Clean design with sorted charts, aligned cards, and simplified visuals.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **DAX**: Created measures like `Intrusion Rate` to calculate anomaly proportions.
- **Power Query**: Transformed data by grouping `service` categories.
- **Data Visualization**: Designed intuitive visuals for cybersecurity analysis.
- **Dashboard Design**: Built a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.
